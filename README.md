# Hello üëã
- This is the first code I wrote, and it was a lot of fun to create, so I hope you'll be understanding.
- Please don't take it too seriously; I spent two days on it, but most features work as intended. 
- I plan to continue developing and improving the code when I have some free time.


# Cookie Clicker Bot
### This script is designed to automate Cookie Clicker.

### Version
- This script was created using Cookie Clicker v2.052. Note that newer features may not be compatible.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver
- Make sure to install the required Python packages using:

# function description

### big_cookie_click:
- Function responsible for collecting golden cookies and clicking the big cookie

### auto_upgrades:
- Function responsible for handling upgrades
- A very simple function. Initially, I intended to create a function that performs calculations based on the cost of an upgrade, its efficiency, and the time required to gather enough resources for that upgrade. However, the function always ends up upgrading the last upgrade, regardless of other factors, which is not the desired behavior.

- I'm very curious about the best way to implement this. If you have any ideas for a better function, please give me a hint.

### close_popups:
- Function responsible for closing pop-ups

### change_bakery_name: 
- Function that notifies everyone that the bot is running (completely useless)

### use_lumps:
- (To activate, uncomment lines 385 and 386). ‚ùó 
-Function responsible for using sugar lumps. It upgrades each upgrade evenly 


### gain_lumps:
- (To activate, uncomment lines 388 and 389). ‚ùó
- Function responsible for adding a sugar lump. It works very well but may disrupt the fun.
- Gives you a sugar lump every 10 seconds, extremely overpowered.
- If you want to be even more overpowered, you can change the amounts or time in the code (lines from 140 to 143), or simply use Game.gainLumps(999999999999999) in the console (press F12)


### ascend: ‚ùó ‚ùó ‚ùó 
- Function may cause issues with other functions and can disrupt the program.
- Function ascend: It is advised not to use it may halt the program. 
- Auto-upgrades are performed in a specified order (chosen by me), but no calculations were made when creating this bot.
- I plan to fix this function soon.

measure_working_time: 
Simple function that tracks the runtime duration of the program.

upgrade_dragon: 
Function that upgrades the dragon.
